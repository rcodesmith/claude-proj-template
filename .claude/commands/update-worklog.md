Please carefully review the changes in the working directory not yet committed to git, including staged changes, and create a summary of the changes made, and add to @worklog.md following the standard format in that file.
Remember, I don't care about the intermediate steps taken, just what the end result is. Also, please keep it as a summary, with the main points. The details aren't needed in the worklog.
